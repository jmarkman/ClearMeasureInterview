# Interview Project

The project goals:
- Implement basic FizzBuzz functionality
- Extract the FizzBuzz logic to its own library that could be used elsewhere
- Allow users to add their own modulo conditions that would return their own custom messages if the modulo operation signaled that the number was divisible by the provided moduli
- Ensure that the library could be used with another project
- Add unit test cases
